-- 1005_edge_smoke_support.sql
-- Purpose: Support Edge function smoke tests with minimal RPCs/views and safe promo ROI refresh.
-- Idempotent and safe across environments.

-- 1) Health ping view used by bootstrap probes and smoke tests
create or replace view public.health_ping_view as
select now() as now;

-- 2) Feature-flag aware IFTA CSV RPC
-- Returns simple aggregated miles/gallons per state for a given org and quarter.
-- When feature flag 'mock_ifta' is enabled, return synthetic rows for quick demos/tests.
create or replace function public.ifta_quarter_csv(org uuid, quarter_date date)
returns table(state text, miles numeric, gallons numeric)

-- 3) Promo ROI refresh with safe caps/timeouts
